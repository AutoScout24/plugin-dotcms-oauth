# AS24 customization and configuration

## Auth0

We added a custom provider for Auth0 integration. It can be tested by running Auth02Example.

When a new user logs in with SSO, the user is created in the local database with a random password. By default, this
user doesn't have any permissions. Permissions must be added by a user manager manually. We might
decide to add some default permissions later.

We disabled the native parameter to use the original authentication method. This would defeat the purpose of
our SSO implementation. When a user changes his own password, he could still use the native form to login although
he was deleted from Azure AD. By disabling the form, logging in is only possible with SSO.

## oauth2.properties
* Uses Auth0 for backend and native login for frontend
* Authentication by SSO, but authorization is in dotCMS
